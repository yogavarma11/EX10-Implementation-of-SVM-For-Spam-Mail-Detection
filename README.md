# EX 10 Implementation of SVM For Spam Mail Detection
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Convert emails into numerical features using tokenization, lowercasing, and TF-IDF or Bag of Words.
2. Transform the processed text into feature vectors for SVM input.
3. Train an SVM classifier (with a linear or other kernel) on labeled data to distinguish between spam and not spam emails.
4. Use the trained SVM model to predict whether new emails are spam and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and precision.
## Program:
```

new_message="Congratulations!"
result=predict_message(new_message)
print(f"The message: '(new_message)' is classified as: {result}")
